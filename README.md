## How to make comments system works ?

The comments is created using [the Staticman API](https://staticman.net/). It allows us to store the comments into a yml file storing in the `_date/comments` folder. You need to deploy the Staticman API on the server.

### Change staticman.yml

### Change the URL in the comment form.
